# 🧐 Project Background

SweetSight is a project that focuses on helping diabetes patients record their blood sugar levels at each time. Recording blood sugar levels can help diabetes patients consult with their doctors regarding the type and amount of insulin that is most suitable for them. This way, their blood sugar levels will be better controlled, reducing the risk that can arise in diabetes patients.
